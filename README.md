## Project Overview

## Self Assessment and Reflection

### Self Assessment

| Category          | Score    |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| **Setup**         | 10 / 10 |
| **Execution**     | 20 / 20 |
| **Documentation** | 10 / 10 |
| **Presentation**  | 28 / 30 |
| **Total**         | 68 / 70 |

### Reflection
I feel as though my documentation and EDA went really well. I also feel as though the question and data gotten back was very interesting and intriguing findings. The last part of my project with the fun facts and using my own data are my favorite part of the project. I feel as though those findings are really cool. I marked some off for my presentation because I felt that I talked really fast and I did not have all of the findings that I have now when I presented.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
